# Student-Table Widget Documentation

A JavaScript widgit that presents an interactive table of students to the user. A form within the widget takes in a students name, email, and level (freshman, sophomore, ...) which when submitted are appended onto an interactive table. Entries can be deleted from this table by pressing the delete key (X). 

This is a sample widgit for a screening test being conducted by Prof Porquet-Lupine in order to participate in on the Code Gist Project.
