# Student-Table Widget Documentation

A JavaScript widgit that presents an interactive table of students to the user. A form within the widget takes in a students name, email, and level (freshman, sophomore, ...) which when submitted are appended onto an interactive table. Under the form exists a search bar which when typed in filters entries by student name. Entries can be editted within this table by pressing the Edit key, or deleted by pressing the Delete key. When a student entry is being editted its name email and level convert into a sub-form. When the subform is completed, it can be saved by pressing the Save key. An alert panel on the bottom of the widget informs the user of any problems if their submissision was illegal, as well as gives reinforcement if a submission is successful. 

Download dist folder and open index.html for use. Widgit can be embedded to any website by pasting Widgit HTML (indicated clearly in index.html) into an existing HTML document. Make sure to include app.js locally and main.css in a local css folder.

This is a sample widgit for a screening test being conducted by Prof Porquet-Lupine in order to participate in on the Code Gist Project.
